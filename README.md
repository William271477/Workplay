# WorkPlay â€” Gamified Job Search

WorkPlay is a small demo React app that gamifies job hunting. It includes:

- Swipe page: Tinder-like job cards (drag to save or skip)
- Profile page: XP and badges (Zustand store)
- Challenges: small career tasks that give XP & badges

This scaffold uses Vite, React, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion (animations), and Zustand (state).

Quick start

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open the printed local URL (usually http://localhost:5173)

Notes

- This is a beginner-friendly scaffold. You can extend it with routing, backend calls, persistent storage, authentication, and a real job API.
- Next suggested steps: add tests, persist XP to localStorage, and improve the swipe UX (stack, undo).
