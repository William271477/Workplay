’m building a gamified job-matching web app called WorkPlay for a hackathon. The theme is Jobs & Economic Resilience. The concept is a Tinder-like experience for finding jobs — users swipe right to express interest, left to skip, and up to save a job. The app should look fun, interactive, and mobile-friendly.

The stack should be:

React + Vite (for speed)

Tailwind CSS (for clean design)

react-tinder-card (for swipe gestures)

Firebase (for mock auth + job data, optional)

Components to build or fix:

Navbar — logo “WorkPlay” and menu (Home, Saved, Profile).

SwipeDeck — center of screen, showing job cards stacked with smooth animations.

JobCard — shows company logo, job title, salary, location, and short description.

Add gamification (XP bar, streaks, badges).

Add light animations (Framer Motion or Tailwind transitions).

Goals:

Make the interface clean and intuitive.

Ensure it’s responsive on mobile and desktop.

Use mock JSON data for jobs (title, company, logo, salary, description).

Add “Match!” or confetti animation when a job is liked.

Use consistent Tailwind design system with gradients, shadows, and rounded cards.

Please fix and redesign the entire app so it fully reflects this concept and looks demo-ready for a hackathon presentation.
